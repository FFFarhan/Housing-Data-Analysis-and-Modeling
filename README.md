# Housing Data Analysis and Modeling

## Overview
This repository contains Python code for analyzing and modeling housing data. The dataset is sourced from a CSV file containing detailed attributes of housing units in various locations. The objective is to explore the data, identify patterns, outliers, and relationships between different features, and build a predictive model for housing prices based on the available attributes.

## Data Description
The dataset consists of the following columns:

1. `longitude`: Longitude coordinate of the location.
2. `latitude`: Latitude coordinate of the location.
3. `housing_median_age`: Median age of the houses in the area.
4. `total_rooms`: Total number of rooms in the housing area.
5. `population`: Population in the housing area.
6. `households`: Number of households in the housing area.
7. `median_income`: Median income of the households in the area.
8. `median_house_value`: Median house value for the housing area.
9. `ocean_proximity`: Proximity of the housing area to the ocean (categorical).

## Contents
1. `housing.csv`: CSV file containing the housing data.
2. `housing_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing Python code for data analysis and modeling.
3. `README.md`: This README file providing an overview of the repository.

## Installation and Usage
To use this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone or download this repository to your local machine using Git or by downloading the ZIP file.

2. **Install Dependencies**: Install the required Python packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file using pip. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**: Open the `housing_analysis.ipynb` notebook in a Jupyter environment. Execute the code cells in the notebook to load the data, perform analysis, visualize the results, and build predictive models.

## Analysis Workflow
The analysis workflow in the Jupyter Notebook includes the following steps:

1. **Data Loading and Inspection**: Load the housing data from the CSV file and inspect its structure, columns, and data types.

2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and preprocess the data for analysis. This may include data type conversions, encoding categorical variables, and handling outliers.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Perform exploratory analysis to understand the distribution of variables, identify patterns, correlations, and outliers. Visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, and box plots are used for EDA.

4. **Outlier Detection and Treatment**: Identify outliers in the data using statistical methods such as Interquartile Range (IQR) and visualize them using box plots. Remove or adjust outliers as necessary.

5. **Correlation Analysis**: Compute correlations between numerical features using correlation matrices and heatmaps to identify relationships between variables.

6. **Feature Engineering**: Extract new features or transform existing ones to improve model performance. This may involve creating dummy variables for categorical features or scaling numerical features.

7. **Model Building**: Build predictive models using linear regression or other regression techniques. Split the data into training and testing sets, fit the model on the training data, and evaluate its performance on the test data.

8. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the trained model using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R2) score. Visualize the observed vs. predicted values to assess model accuracy.

## Libraries Used
The analysis and modeling tasks are implemented using the following Python libraries:

- **pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **numpy**: Numerical operations and computations.
- **matplotlib**: Data visualization and plotting.
- **seaborn**: Statistical data visualization.
- **statsmodels**: Statistical modeling and hypothesis testing.
- **scikit-learn**: Machine learning modeling and evaluation.
